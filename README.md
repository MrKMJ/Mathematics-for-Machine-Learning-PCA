## Contents

* **Distance and Angles between Images.ipynb**

    * Implements functions to calculate the distance and angle between image vectors.
    * Demonstrates the application of these concepts to the MNIST digit dataset.
    * Covers the use of distance and angle as measures of similarity.
    * Prepares the groundwork for algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors.

* **Orthogonal Projections.ipynb**

    * Provides implementations for performing orthogonal projections.
    * Focuses on projecting data into lower-dimensional subspaces.
    * Includes practical advice for testing numerical algorithms.
    * Uses the Olivetti faces dataset to demonstrate projections.

* **Principal Component Analysis.ipynb**

    * Implements the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm.
    * Includes implementations for both standard PCA and PCA for high-dimensional datasets.
    * Applies PCA to the MNIST digit dataset for dimensionality reduction.
